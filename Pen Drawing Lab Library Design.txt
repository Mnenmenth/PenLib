create grid
init takes desired amount of points on x and y
	add one to each so there is buffer space on all sides of the screen
divide width of screen by x to get position of first line. Increment position to get other line positions
do the same for height and y
get the intersections of the lines to create the drawable points for the cursor

line intersection points:
	seperate lines into vertical and horizontal
	for every vertical line:
		iterate through horizontal lines and test for intersection of two lines

Point class holds index of position point in vertical point list and horizontal point list so it knows where it is. also holds current rotation 
based on 360 to hold direction
	
	funcs:
		pu: draw = false
		pd: draw = true
		fd(x): move to next index in line list based on direction
		lt(x): must be 90 || 180 || 270, rotate current direction towards the left
		rt(x): must be 90 || 180 || 270, rotate current direction towards the right (just put "-" in front of x to rotate to the right)
